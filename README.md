# Odin
For the projects done using [The Odin Project's](http://www.theodinproject.com/) Web Development tutorial.

### 1.0 Doople
[First project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css), a mini-project in HTML and CSS, is to reproduce the Google search page (the simple one) for like appearance.

I named it _Doople_ because it's a *duplicate* of Google. It's silly, I know.

### 2.1 Joyler
[Secondish project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-basics), an exercise in Javascript. Just for funsies, I have made an HTML "shell" to collect and deliver my Javascript with buttons and everything! I say _secondish_ because this one is not so much a project as a reason to use Javascript.

The project is to complete several of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) problems. Veracity was checked using [this list of sloutions](https://code.google.com/p/projecteuler-solutions/wiki/ProjectEulerSolutions).

I named it _Joyler_ because it's Javascript and Euler (which is pronounced 'oiler'). I'm sorry it's not particularly clever.
