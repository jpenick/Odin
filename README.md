# Odin
For the projects done using [The Odin Project's](http://www.theodinproject.com/) Web Development tutorial.

### Doople
First project, a mini-project in HTML and CSS, is to reproduce the Google search page (the simple one) for like appearance.

I named it _doople_ because it's a *duplicate* of Google. It's silly, I know.
