# Odin
For the projects done using [The Odin Project's](http://www.theodinproject.com/) Web Development tutorial.

### Doople
First project, a mini-project in HTML and CSS, is to reproduce the Google search page (the simple one) for like appearance.

I named it _Doople_ because it's a *duplicate* of Google. It's silly, I know.

### Joyler
[Second project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-basics), an exercise in Javascript. Just for funsies, I have made an HTML "shell" to collect and deliver my Javascript with buttons and everything!

The project is to complete several of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) problems.

I named it _Joyler_ because it's Javascript and Euler (which is pronounced 'oiler'). I'm sorry it's not particularly clever.
