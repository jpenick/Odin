# Odin
For the projects done using [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Web Dev tutorial.

## Doople
Frist project, a mini-project in HTML and CSS, is to reproduce the Google search page (the simple one) for like appearance.

I named it _doople_ because it's a _doopl_icate of google. It's silly, I know.
