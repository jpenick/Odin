# Odin
For the projects done using [The Odin Project's](http://www.theodinproject.com/) Web Development tutorial.

### 1.0 Doople
[First project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css), a mini-project in HTML and CSS, is to reproduce the Google search page (the simple one) for like appearance.

I named it _Doople_ because it's a *duplicate* of Google. It's silly, I know.

### 2.1 Joyler
[Mini second project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-basics), an exercise in Javascript. I have made an HTML "shell" to collect and deliver my Javascript.

The project is to complete several of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) problems. Veracity was checked using [this list of sloutions](https://code.google.com/p/projecteuler-solutions/wiki/ProjectEulerSolutions).

I named it _Joyler_ because it's Javascript and Euler (which is pronounced 'oiler'). I'm sorry it's not particularly clever.

### 2.2 playQuery
The actual [second project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-and-jquery) is to make a browser version of something akin to sketchpad and Etch-A-Sketch.

_playQuery_ is forced, I'm aware.

### 3 GemSetter
Nothing punny here, sorry. The [third project](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/ruby?ref=lnav) is an exercise in testing and test-driven development. The project requires the use of Ruby and RSpec to pass several of tests provided by [testfirst.org](http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby#install). The [repo I will be using](https://github.com/vikingeducation/learn_ruby), however, is updated for RSpec 3.
